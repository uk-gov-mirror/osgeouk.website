### Changing Components

For e.g. to change `footer`, follow the steps

- Copy the `footer.html` from source [_includes/partials/footer.html](https://github.com/DigitaleGesellschaft/jekyll-theme-conference/blob/main/_includes/partials/footer.html)
- Create the same folder structure: `touch _includes/partials/footer.html`
- Paste the contents from the source and override/add the code
